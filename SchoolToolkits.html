    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The interviews conducted throughout the
    course of this community needs assessment with school officials, including
    counselors, teachers and other faculty, suggest that there is not
    consistent awareness of the symptoms of food insecurity in children or what
    options are available for food insecure families. In one area surveyed,
    twenty out of thirty eight pantry visitors with children stated that the
    reason they did not utilize free summer feeding was because they didn&#39;t
    know about the program. In addition to this, school faculty frequently
    expressed frustration over not knowing what options are available to them
    for addressing food insecurity within their schools.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">My recommendation for starting to address
    this issue is to develop two toolkits for distribution in schools,
    beginning with schools in areas estimated to have a high rate of food
    insecurity.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The first of these two toolkits would be
    written to be distributed to school faculty, mainly teachers and
    counselors. This toolkit would include information about some of the signs
    of food insecurity in children, as well and what sorts of long term health
    and developmental impacts periods of food insecurity can have on children.
    The toolkit would include the two food insecurity screening questions,
    which could be asked by teachers in parent-teacher conferences, or other
    private meetings with parents or guardians, and include information about
    next steps if they receive a positive response.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The second toolkit would be written to be
    distributed by school faculty to parents or guardians, and be more along
    the lines of a list of resources and how to access them, as well as include
    some information about how to safely and healthily stretch a food budget.
    This could be customized for each school with information about which
    pantries are closest, who to call for a pantry referral or to begin a SNAP
    application, closest summer feeding sites, school counselor information, or
    any other location dependent information.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Ideally, the distribution of these resources
    would be paired with an in-person presentation from a member of Food Bank
    staff, in order to explain why this resource is being provided, ensure the
    toolkits are not glossed over by administration, present compelling
    information on the impacts of child hunger, and to answer any questions
    that might arise.</span></p>
